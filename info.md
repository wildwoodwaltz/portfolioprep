Personal Headline: Programming for the future of all

Professional Pitch

Hello, Iâ€™m Tai, and I am a software developer with a passion for empowering people to make their lives more easily through the use of technology. Development and deployment of software and firmware was something that I looked at for a long time, before making the jump from the medical field to technology. Everything we use today is touched by technology, from agriculture to entertainment. I find a passion in empowering people to live their lives more easily through the use of technology. The world is changing every day, and technology has become such an integral part of it. Using my skills in communication, logical deduction, and research. I firmly believe that I can be a part of that change, helping technology become more accessible for all. 

What excites me about tech. 

Technology has been a driving factor in the progression of our society, and I beleive it is important to be a driving force of that change. My math teacher once told me I would never have a calculator in my pocket growing up, and guess what... I now have a whole computer. It never ceases to amaze me the things we can develop and innovate with the tools at our disposal.
